# Permutation Feature Importance

## Overview
This project implements a permutation feature importance analysis (e.g.; [Permutation Feature Importance](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/permutation_importance.html)). It further allows the permutation of predefined sets of features which is particularly useful for analyses where features are grouped or interdependent, and their collective impact on model performance needs to be assessed.
